FAQ
1. Why don't you add [mod name]?
If you would like me to add a mod, feel free to contact me on discord. Fish Core Sodium does not support immersive portals, and other mods and resource packs that are dependent on optifine as Fish Core Sodium runs Sodium forge ports as Halogen and Magnesium for much better FPS. Not optifine
2. Where can I change the modded hud?
To change Location/Settings of Inventory HUD+ (The mod that 1. Lets you see what is in your inventory 2. Lets you see your armor 3. Lets you see your effects) press ""O"" on your  keyboard
3. Is there a server for the modpack?
While the modpack IS made for multiplayer, no server will be created until I receive enough donations to run it. You can donate by clicking the donate button to the right above the categories and next to the follow button.
COMMON ISSUES
If your game crashes while creating a world that means that the game has run out of RAM. Search up a tutorial on how to allocate more RAM to Minecraft. If you are on the Curse forge app then search up the tutorial for the curse forge app, and if it still doesn't have enough RAM then your laptop/pc is too weak to run this modpack.
If your world is stuck at 80-99% generating then restart Minecraft
(for 1.16 versions) If blocks are invisible then uninstall the halogen mod. It drastically increases performance but causes rendering issues. To be able to edit the mods inside the modpack press the download button on one of the versions (not the install button) and then import the file as a profile into the curse forge app.

Supports all spanish variations / slangs.
How to install

Who are we?
We're a small team with one simple goal: bring spanish translations to all mods as possible.
Modded MC has a great chunk of spanish translated mods, but sadly, there's a lot more that aren't. There are also some cases where translations are inconsistent or incomplete.
That's why we decided to make HTP, to try to fix this task.
Open Source
Our project is open source, contribution friendly, and most importantly,
under the Public Domain.
If you're a mod developer and want to add our translations officially to your mod, feel free to! We encourage it.
These pages will still be updated frequently and serve as an unofficial translation, but the content of them is free to use for everyone.
Contributing
If you're a native spanish speaker and want to contribute by either adding more translations or proofreading, you can open a
Pull Request
in our
Github Repository
.
Donating
Your best donation is a contribution on our

If you don't want to open a pull request, you can always make an issue pointing out stuff to be improved on.

paradise-lost,Parasitic Paradise LITE,https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/parasitic-paradise-2-0,"This modpack is a new or 2.0 (Lite) version of my other modpack, ""
Parasitic Paradise
"". Similarly to Parasitic Paradise, this modpacks main feature is the Scape And Run Parasites mod. There are also a few other mods that add on to this mods machanics and gameplay. Some being ""
Scape And Run Parasites: Deep Sea Danger
"", ""
Scape And Run Parasites: Parasites Quark
"", and ""
Scape and Run: Parasites Extra
"". These three extra mods add onto the parasites featured in the mod itself.
Other mods like ""
AmbiantSounds 6
"", and ""
Sound Filters
"" add realistic sound features that make the gameplay more emmersive. There is also a resource pack called ""
Scape And Run Parasites | Dynamic Sounds
"" that add these sound effects to the parasites in the mod.
The reason this mod is a ""
Lite
"" version of the original is becuase there are many less mods to smoothen out performance and allow for lower end computers to run the modpack with ease.
Good luck out there!"
